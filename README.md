This project consists of:
- Front end Angular app to upload a picture and display the result of the ML prediction
- Back end Flask server to process an image and run it through the ML model
- Jupyter Notebook used for training
- undersampled.csv indicating the filenames of the images used

This is not the optimal way to deploy ML models using TF but can be used if you need the model in production yesterday
